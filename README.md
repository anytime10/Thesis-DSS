# Determinants of Mathematics Achievement Scores: A Machine Learning Approach with Cross-Sectional Data from PISA

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and data used to conduct the experiments for my Master's thesis in **Data Science and Society** at Tilburg University. The study evaluates and compares the performance of various Machine Learning algorithms in predicting the mathematics scores of Italian students who participated in the PISA 2022 assessment.<br>
The dataset is publicy available to download at the [PISA website](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/pisa-2022-database.html#data). All the analyses were carried out in Python, version 3.9.13.
